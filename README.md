#Raytracer

A raytracer.
Not intended to be useful or fast, but I'll try any feature that I find fun
and/or usefull until I get bored.

## TODO:
* Use Texture objects instead of Color Objects:
    * Easier Loading
    * easier Use
    * implement perlin noise / real textures
* polygons
* more objects
* more solvers
* photon mapping
* finish phong
* cell shading
* ???
